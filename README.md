# 4.0 Schools WordPress Theme

This public repo contains the _upcoming_ WordPress theme for [4pt0.org]. This theme is designed with young creatives from [YEP Design Works].

## Issue Reporting and Questions
Issues and questions can be added under this repo's ["Issues" tab]. Labels should be added to each issue and issues can be assigned to particular developers. [@bbertucc] is the primary developer of the 4.0 Schools project. Checkout the [repo wiki] for helpful guides.

## Development
The `master` branch includes the most stable site build. Other branches are feature specific. 

`4pt0-theme` is actively updated to incorporate stable technology, architecture, and best practices. The [_s] and [Sage] themes were huge inspirations for the theme architecture. We love to follow [DRY] principles and keep features and elements modular. 

## Required Plugins
To run this theme on your own WordPress site, [Advanced Custom Fields] (version 5+) must be installed.

## Code Style & Naming Conventions
We're a stickler about naming conventions and style. Checkout [@bbertucc's gist] to understand how we style WordPress theme code. We also love the [code guide] by [@mdo].

## Contributing
`4pt0-theme` is open for contributions. You can report issues under the ["Issues" tab], or fork this repo and help code. We'd love to include your updates!
